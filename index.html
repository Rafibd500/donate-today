                    <p>When the floodwaters rushed in, ten-year-old Barsha and her family had to hurry to a shelter, leaving behind everything.
                    The cramped shelter in Gowainghat of Sylhet, one of the worst-affected districts, provided respite from the rising
                    water. But, with no tube wells or taps nearby, Barsha had to go without clean drinking water for days.</p>

                    items in the middle of a crisis will create anxiety and chaos in the midst of having to get to safety.</p>

                    <p>A natural disaster - such as an earthquake, tsunami and hurricane - can overwhelm an entire population within minutes.
                    Thousands of people may be killed and many more left injured or traumatised by the loss of friends, families and homes.
                    In the face of such events, Médecins Sans Frontières / Doctors Without Borders (MSF) can deploy a rapid response to save
